smash! the ceiling
main.py

TODO by end of Thanksgiving:

make main shorter:
    - move everything to level manager

forcefield:
    - follows the blob: completed
    - make drawing of forcefield and collision box bigger
    - need to create a new drawing

levels:
    - completed: different color schemes for different levels
    - one more level with original blob (vertical that goes to ceiling)
    - one level with one of the other blobs
    - not started

boss enemy:
    - character that spawns mini blobs
    - have to avoid hitting the blobs: takes down wokeness meter or something like that

smash animation:
    - running toward trying to smash the ceiling unsuccessful
    - animation that shows that you have to train other blobs

menus:
    - start menu
    - blob selection screen:
        - three other blobs to select from
        - once you click on one it takes you to next level with one of the blobs


cheats to go to end of level:
    - cheat codes

music and sound effects:
    - background music: the man by taylor swift, nightmare by halsey if possible

make screen bigger for demo:
    - upscale
